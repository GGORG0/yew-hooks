# Yew Hooks

Hooks for [Yew](https://github.com/yewstack/yew), inspired by [streamich/react-use](https://github.com/streamich/react-use) and [alibaba/hooks](https://github.com/alibaba/hooks).

## Hooks

### State

- `use_toggle` - tracks state of counterparts.
- `use_bool_toggle` - tracks state of a boolean.
- `use_counter` -  tracks state of a number.

### Lifecycles

- `use_effect_once` - a modified use_effect hook that only runs once.
- `use_mount` - calls mount callbacks.
- `use_unmount` - calls unmount callbacks.
